# ðŸŽ² Board Quest API ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the Board Quest API, a portfolio project designed to emulate a real world backend service.

Board Quest allows table top enthusiasts to explore the world of board games together and speak of their tales along the way. 

Interacting with the API allows users to browse, post and vote on reviews and comments.

### Heroku App:

#### [nc-board-quest.herokuapp.com/api](https://nc-board-quest.herokuapp.com/api)
--- 

## Exploring the Project

**Requirements:**

The database is created with PSQL and interaction occurs through [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/). Therefore up-to-date versions of `Node.js` and `Postgres` are needed to run this project.

**Setup:**

1. Fork and clone this repository

2. Install all dependencies: 
    * `npm install`   
    <br />

3. Create _two_ `.env` files: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names).    

4. Connect to the database:
    * `npm run setup-dbs`

    <br />

5. Seeding development data:
    * `npm run seed` 
    
    <br />

6. Seeding and testing test data:
    * `npm test app`

    <br />
